# vas3k.blog

This repository contains the source code of my blog ‚Äî https://vas3k.blog

It is completely custom and is not intended to be used as a universal blog engine. I keep his code here purely because why not. Open Source FTW!

‚ö†Ô∏è Use it at your own risk! I'm not responsible for any damages or your wasted time trying to get your blog up and running on this. Also, I don't provide any support for this code, sorry.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech details

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11+
- Django 4+
- PostgreSQL
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a package manager

**Frontend:**
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- Mostly pure JS, no webpack, no builders
- No CSS framework

**Blogging part:**
- Markdown with a bunch of [custom plugins](common/markdown/plugins)

**CI/CD:**
- Github Actions + SSH deployment using [docker-compose.production.yml](docker-compose.production.yml) as a service configuration


## üèóÔ∏è How to build

If you like to build it from scratch:

```
$ pip3 install poetry
$ poetry install
$ poetry run manage.py migrate
$ poetry run manage.py runserver 8000
```

Don't forget to create an empty Postgres database called `vas3k_blog` or your migrations will fail.

Another option for those who prefer Docker:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 and see an empty page.

## ü§î Contributions, etc
