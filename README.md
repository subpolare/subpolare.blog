## üèóÔ∏è How to build

If you like to build it from scratch:

```
createdb subpolare
psql subpolare -c "CREATE ROLE postgres WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'postgres';"
```

```
pip3 install poetry
poetry install
poetry run python manage.py migrate
poetry run python manage.py runserver 8000
```

Don't forget to create an empty Postgres database called `vas3k_blog` or your migrations will fail.

Another option for those who prefer Docker:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 and see an empty page.
